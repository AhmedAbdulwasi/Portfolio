# My Portfolio
Entirely updated my portfolio website putting all my pages into one single page that includes Home, About, Work Experience, Projects, and Contacts. This project relies on React.js + Vite, HTML and Tailwind CSS. You can access the website here: https://ahmedabdulwasi.github.io/portfolio/

## Why?
A place where I can talk about myself and showcase my abilities. Also at the same time, I gained more experience in web development (Specifically in React.js, and Tailwind). I also learned Git basics such as commits, adds, checkouts, branches, etc.
